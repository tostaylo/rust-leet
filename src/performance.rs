// Can this be made more generic?
// Or do I need to make a seperate test function for each function parameter and return type
// Do I instead need to create a struct which compares has methods for compare_perF_vec, compare_perf_string, etc?
// Or do I cast the function being passed in as a specific type I create? Or implements a trait I create?
// Many possibilities here.
// functions: Vec<fn(Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32>> this works but isn't flexible
// generic type where T implements a clone trait?
// If I figure this out, this could be a blog post
// So now I have it for Clone trait but do strings implement Clone trait?
// May still need to make a struct for this with methods for strings vs vecs
